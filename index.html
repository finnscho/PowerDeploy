        <h3>Welcome to PowerDeploy</h3>
        
        <pre>
        I used to implement PowerDeploy in PowerShell. A couple of weeks ago i changed my decision and im going to do as much
        as possible in C# with proper unit testing. So I have to implement a lot of things I've already implemented 
        with PowerShell which took some time. But I promise you: it will be much better!
        
        The neutral package will be in future a nuget package which can be published to any nuget server. This new approach
        gives me a lot of new opportunities.
        
        Current State:
          - The core library is almost done. Some finetuning needed, but functions are done.
          - XCopy and IIS deployments are implemented (IIS deployment go through a DeploymentService, i gave it up to deal with webdeploy or powershell snappis, it just didn't work out as well as expected')
          - Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager Extension: enables to switch between environments locally -> done
          - NuGet Package Manager extension which allows to do manual deployments with the NuGet Package Manager (npe.codeplex.com)
          - I'm working now on a website called "PowerDeploy Dashboard"
